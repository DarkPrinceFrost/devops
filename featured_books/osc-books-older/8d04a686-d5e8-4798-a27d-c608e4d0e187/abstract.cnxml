<para><emphasis effect="italics">College Physics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</emphasis> is designed to engage students in their exploration of physics and help them to relate what they learn in the classroom to their lives and to apply these concepts to the Advanced Placement<sup>®</sup> test. Physics underlies much of what is happening today in other sciences and in technology, therefore the book includes interesting facts and ideas that go beyond the scope of the AP<sup>®</sup> course to further student understanding. The AP® Connection in each chapter directs students to the material they should focus on for the AP<sup>®</sup> exam, and what content — although interesting — is not necessarily part of the AP<sup>®</sup> curriculum.</para>

<para><emphasis effect="italics">College Physics for AP<sup>®</sup> Courses</emphasis> introduces topics conceptually and steadily progresses to precise definitions and analytical applications. The analytical aspect (problem solving) is tied back to the concept before moving to another topic. Each introductory chapter, for example, opens with a photograph relevant to the subject of the chapter and interesting applications that are easy for most students to visualize.</para>
